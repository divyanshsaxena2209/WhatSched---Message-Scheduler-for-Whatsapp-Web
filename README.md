# WhatSched---Message-Scheduler-for-Whatsapp-Web
WhatSched is a privacy focused Chrome extension designed to schedule WhatsApp Web messages with high reliability and precision while operating entirely on the client side. The extension integrates directly into the WhatsApp Web interface, allowing users to schedule messages from within the chat window using an intuitive modal and keyboard shortcuts. All scheduling data is stored locally using browser storage and processed through background alarms, eliminating the need for external servers and ensuring full user data ownership. WhatSched intelligently manages browser tabs and windows by detecting WhatsApp state, bringing it to focus only when required, executing message delivery accurately, and restoring the user’s workspace afterward. It includes detailed timestamp based logging, delivery history tracking, failure detection, retry safeguards, and exact time execution with drift awareness. The system is built to handle edge cases such as archived chats, inactive tabs, UI readiness issues, and user interference while maintaining a smooth and native user experience. WhatSched is ideal for users who value automation, precision, and privacy without compromising control or relying on third party services.
